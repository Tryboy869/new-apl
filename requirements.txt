# New APL Dependencies
# Minimal requirements for array processing and data analysis

# Core dependencies - only what's essential
# New APL prioritizes minimal dependencies for maximum compatibility

# Built-in Python modules used (no installation needed):
# - csv (data loading)
# - json (data interchange) 
# - time (performance measurement)
# - statistics (basic statistical functions)
# - re (natural language parsing)
# - pathlib (file operations)

# Optional enhancements (auto-installed if needed):
# numpy==1.24.3          # For advanced array operations comparison
# pandas==2.0.3          # For performance benchmarking against pandas

# Future enhancement possibilities:
# matplotlib==3.7.2      # For visualization features
# scipy==1.11.1          # For advanced statistical functions
# jupyter==1.0.0         # For notebook interface
